# libeznet
A C++ library which is supposed to make network programming easier, intuitive and more object oriented with minimal abstraction cost

## Current Work
httpclient class does provide some abstraction but it is far from what I expect to provide. I will keep working on HTTP to begin in the http/ directory.

## Plan
The current plan is to include as much boilerplate code as possible for various protocols and create classes for them. If this does not help anyone, atleast I get to learn a lot about network programming.
